### You are to create plots that would enable understanding of the data.

- From plots about aggregates to those that have to do with trends. 
 
- Your Notebook should be as detailed as possible.

- Someone should be able to tell which areas had more deaths/infections/recoveries without having to actually look at the numbers.
- Someone should be able to observe trend from your visualizations without looking at the data

- Your plott functions should allow for slicing/selecting. i.e. If someone wants to observe data from different countries/continents they should be able to do so by simply switching the selection criteria for example.

- Download the files from Kaggle and use them for this project.
