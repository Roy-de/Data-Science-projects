# BINANCE PIPELINE

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
In the rapidly evolving landscape of cryptocurrency
markets, the need for accurate and timely data is
paramount for making informed decisions. The challenge
lies in creating a robust and automated system to extract
Bitcoin prices from the Binance exchange, store the data
in a reliable database, and implement an Airflow pipeline
for real-time extraction and calculation of the average
prices.

### KEY CHALLENGES
##### Data Extraction from Binance:
• Developing a secure and efficient mechanism to retrieve real-time Bitcoin price data from the Binance API.

• Handling potential API rate limitations and ensuring continuous data flow without disruptions.

##### Data Storage in DataStax Cassandra Database:
•Designing a scalable schema for storing Bitcoin price data in a DataStax Cassandra database.

•Implementing mechanisms for data validation, ensuring consistency, and managing database connections.

##### Airflow Pipeline Implementation:
• Creating an Airflow pipeline to automate the extraction of Bitcoin prices from the Cassandra database.

• Ensuring fault tolerance and error handling to maintain the integrity of the pipeline.

###### Real-time Calculation of Average Prices:
• Developing a mechanism to calculate the average Bitcoin prices every minute based on the extracted data.

• Implementing a strategy for handling missing or inconsistent data during the calculation process.
##### Integration of Results:
• Integrating the calculated average prices into a format suitable for analysis and decision-making.
• Providing mechanisms for easy visualization and reporting of the calculated averages.

###
The successful implementation of this project will empower
cryptocurrency enthusiasts, traders, and decision-makers with
accurate and timely information, facilitating better decision-
making in the dynamic and volatile world of cryptocurrency
markets.

### CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the proposed projectaddresses the critical need for accurate and timely Bitcoin price data in the
dynamic cryptocurrency market. By extracting real-time data from Binance, storing it in a reliable DataStax Cassandra database, and implementing an Airflow pipeline for continuous extraction and average price calculation, the system aims to empower users with valuable insights for informed decision-making.
